This repository contains the Tasks which were assigned to me during my Virtual Internship at CodeClause. 


## **Task - 1 Churn Prediction in Telecom Industry using Logistic Regression** 

The ***Customer Churn Dataset*** contains information of 7,043 customers from a **Telecommunication Industry in California**. 
Each record represents ***one customer*** and details about their ****demographics, location, tenure, subscription services, status for the quarter (joined, stayed or churned)***, and more.

## **Task - 2 Market Basket Analysis in Python using Apriori Algorithm** 

The ***dataset of a mall*** with 7500 transactions of different customers buying different items from the store is taken into consideration. The aim is to find correlations between the different items in the store. So that store can know if a customer is buying apple, banana and mango, what is the next item, the customer would be interested in buying from the store.
**Apriori** is a popular algorithm for extracting frequent itemsets with applications in association rule learning. The apriori algorithm has been designed to operate on databases containing transactions, such as purchases by customers of a store.
